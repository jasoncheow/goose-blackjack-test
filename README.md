# Blackjack Game

This project is a [Goose](https://block.github.io/goose/) experiment where code, repository creation, push to GitHub, and even this README generation were all completed with the assistance of Goose, an AI agent. This serves as an experiment to explore the capabilities of AI in revolutionizing software development, assisting in all stages from initial coding to deployment and documentation.

Interestingly, my first JavaScript game was also Blackjack. This project feels like exploring development from scratch again, but in a new way, leveraging the power of AI assistance.
