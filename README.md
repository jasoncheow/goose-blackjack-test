# Blackjack Game

This project is a [Goose](https://block.github.io/goose/) experiment where code, repository creation, push to GitHub, and even this README generation were all completed with the assistance of Goose, an AI agent. This serves as an experiment to explore the capabilities of AI in revolutionizing software development, assisting in all stages from initial coding to deployment and documentation.

Back in the early days of starting software development, the first JavaScript game I wrote was Blackjack. Revisiting it now feels like exploring development from scratch again, but in a new way, leveraging the power of AI assistance.
